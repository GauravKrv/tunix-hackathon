# DEPRECATED: The evaluate.py script has been replaced with samples.md
# 
# The evaluation approach has been updated to focus on concrete before-and-after
# samples rather than computed metrics. Please see samples.md for evaluation
# methodology and example outputs.
#
# For quantitative accuracy metrics, you can run inference on test sets using
# inference.py and manually compare results.
