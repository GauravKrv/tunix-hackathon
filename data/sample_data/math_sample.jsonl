{"problem": "Find the domain of the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.", "level": "Level 5", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "The expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore, $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.", "answer": "[2,5)"}
{"problem": "If $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Precalculus", "solution": "We have that $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12) = \\boxed{24}.$", "answer": "24"}
{"problem": "Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?", "level": "Level 1", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight. If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight. Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$: \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}", "answer": "16"}
{"problem": "If the system of equations \\begin{align*} 6x-4y&=a,\\\\ 6y-9x &=b. \\end{align*}has a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero, find $\\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b$ is nonzero.", "level": "Level 4", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "Multiply the first equation by $-\\frac{3}{2}$ to obtain $$-9x+6y=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since $-9x+6y=b$, we have $$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$", "answer": "-\\frac{2}{3}"}
{"problem": "If $x+y=\\frac{7}{12}$ and $x-y=\\frac{1}{12}$, what is the value of $x^2-y^2$? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "level": "Level 2", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "$x^2-y^2$ factors into $(x+y)(x-y)$, so, to obtain the value of $x^2-y^2$, simply multiply $\\frac{7}{12}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{144}}$.", "answer": "\\frac{7}{144}"}
